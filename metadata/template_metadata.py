    "Days never felt so long before. Wondering when I will see you again. Always listening for you and longing to hold you in my arms again. Holding the fabric softener sheets that I'm waiting to use in a thankful prayer today.",
    "They never had a chance when the storm came. The freight trolly smashed into the family wagon, breaking the dad's neck as he sat beside the driver. The mother and brother barely escaped with their lives. She remembers the agony of watching the train slowly crush the wagon, and seeing her brother and her dad shrivel and blacken.",
    "The fire had torn through the town, threatening the Aquarius and taking rescuers six hours to arrive, she said. “We would never have imagined they would leave us,” said one woman who lost her daughter, younger sister, and family friends.",
    "This is a long night in Tabishan, as sometimes the rain is just heavy and you get wet to your bones. But before we could go home, we decided to try and do our laundry. If we had known it would take half a day to do it, I think we would have just stayed in our room. So we bundled up and headed into the rain to the laundry.",
    "The world wasn't ready for the day I arrived, which meant I had to destroy the world to make a safe way for the people to get to the sun, but now I have the time and power to build a world that's going to be so much better.",
    "The winter was long this year when I was drafted. I believe it was the spring of 144 EC when I was drafted into the Army. My training was in Fort Oglethorpe, Genogia. My first memories of going to boot camp was from those soldiers who were very stern. They told us to buck up. They were tough guys.",
    "The summer came and went in a haze. We had fun, we were happy, we enjoyed each other's company. My birthday came and went. It was a busy but fun day with my friends and family. By that time, I was starting to struggle.",
    "We were a wreck that day. It was really hard to hold it together. We went up to Lili's new room and kept it together. I left a few minutes later and just sobbed. It was a lot. The hard part was I felt like my friends were avoiding me, they didn't know what to say to me so they were quiet.",
    "When the Second Landing happen, we were at first excited. We assumed that it would be the location where we'd find the place where Glanis's memory was, which we'd then erase. But when we reached it, we found that it was completely empty and in ruin. We spent a lot of time there, wondering what could have possibly happened. When I was poking around.",
    "The Second Landing, what a joke that turned out to be. If there was a master of jackassery then it was Jamie MacTavish. She was stunned. Jamie? Why would he be here? What the hell was going on?",
    "When the soldiers found us, we knew we weren't saved. \"God, you got us out, but you don't have us. You sent us here to die. You want us to live, but you can't give us more than we can take. In our dark misery, you have turned on the only light we have. We've come here to learn and are learning, but you aren't letting us see what you are doing.\"",
    "The militia was underprepared. If an army had been against them, they would have lost. Instead, the townspeople and the militia fought back. The small town was able to stop the attacking army in a decisive battle. Some militia.",
    "The firing squad had aim like a blind man pissing in the dark. I would have hit the earth and spent the next six months seeking medical assistance to walk again. Those eighteen lads were given a second chance and to be honest if they hadn't gone for it the next in line would have walked out of the room without so much as a finger wag.",
    "Those were her dying wish. What a shame. I used to work for an organization that sent grants to museums across Astaia to help support the Extraordinary. They lost so much of that stock after the flood.",
    "I hated everyone of them, but they saved my life. They believed in me and helped me. It was then when my life was good. I didn't need that stupid savior. I didn't need anyone. I was strong enough. Alive enough. As it was, I killed them all and went back to my old town. But a new fear followed me, a new one. They had not given up hope.",
    "She called me her savior... You see, at 12 years old, my niece was the same age that I was when I started having surgery. A not so young innocent little girl. The first few weeks after getting her new metal limbs, she cried because she couldn't see her old ones. She thought that they were underneath the metal ones...",
    "I worked on replacing limbs with metal casts. They loved them, once they got acclimated, I never had the hard to tell them who paid for them, and why... ",
    "The army killed my family for training practice. I decided to jump off the bridge in order to save their lives. So I was hiding on the other side of the bridge when the cavalry came, shooting and killing everyone.",
    "I had my joints filled in with a metal plate. My doctors told me that I'd probably never know how much pain I was in until I was almost done the healing process. Apparently, my body must have had a difficult time adjusting to my new organs as they were not used to being in the wrong places.",
    "They gave me the weapon and told me to use it first, think second. Not having much to lose, and it's not like I can actually lose anyway, I shrugged off the melancholy. I went into the forest, the forest I grew up in. I found a gun that I can use.",
    "It was a foul night. We stopped to get some air outside of Portsmouth. No one was around. In fact, it was pretty much just a couple of people leaving a restaurant that was next to the library where we were stopping.",
    "They called it a crime, I did what I had to. I didn't need to save the world, but I could help the one who had. I am no hero, but I have been granted powers that few would believe if they were told, even by me. I know what you're thinking, it can't be that bad. Think again. I know what you're thinking. It can't be that bad.",
    "The serpent of the abyss beckons upon those who fell ill to the threat of sorrow. She is the gate of death and of darkness. The serpent lives to torment, to torture, and to kill. It is a demon who lies in wait for the living. In that dark place of horror, the serpent is given the power to make, yet only takes.",
    "Sundry of Tilroy is a brute of short-lived temperament. With the face of a canary, this serpent has a mind of quick comprehension, an understanding of what the other is thinking. He is not of this world, though he is of it, for his heart is in the dark. Tilroy is an inhuman creature, a monster who will feast on those it neglects. ",
    "There was never a more horrid lackluster beast to enter into Fillanthris's heart. He had never been this angry, or this miserable. All he could think of was the woman he loved, and the way she was being taken from him. \"She's gone\", he muttered. ",
    "Fillanthris was a sweet pleasant mistress of the night, yet her misdeeds led to great torment. The last words she ever said to her's were, You'll never be mine. His heart cracked in two, just as the other had. She was gone now, he was sure. Forgotten. So was all that he had done.",
    "The broken-hearted, wicked Thatcher stole away Fillanthris from her lover. Fillanthris had no tears left in her eyes, no pity for him. There was no mercy in him, only the hatred of a man, a god of vengeance. She had taken her own life, for the only way he would ever let released of her.",
    "The god of death is both a man and a ghost, both mortal and immortal, the same in each of his incarnations. His human incarnation, his god form, is often depicted as a squat, hairy, angry man with a black beard and dwarfish demeanor",
    "The Ghost of Fillanthris haunts newly-lovers, a stark warning of the perils that come with devotion.",
    "The creature was about the size of a dog, red and blue-black in color, that wore a long black robe with a black skullcap. Its eyes glowed with dark flames and it had a thin black line of smoke trailing behind it like a memory of a tail long since torn off.",
    "Victor was of no royalty despite his collection of slaves and lost souls, a collection that included the Ghost of Fillanthris. A tiny little thing in the flesh of an old man. As it says in ancient Gilbatree, his head filled with a golden light. Of course, his minded led him blind.",
    "Betrise of Old never saw her son before he departed to fight the great war over Gilbatree. Her heart broke for her little boy, as she had hoped he would join his father in the war. Betrise's thoughts and prayers for him were words she could not hear, only the words of her beloved, the God of Abraham.",
    "Jenny was a man strong twelve years early. Easily the biggest music star alive, until today. On his bed lay jenny and half a pint of milk. Jenny’s mother, Mrs Samuel, age 53 never saw her son so bliss.",
    'Fire and Ice had no fued like Arceus and Motwo had, it was just one sided, as such Spence decided he was done with it, "In your dreams..."',
    "There was never a night of rest since the mission had begun. The Commander only had enough supplies to survive a few more days, and she refused to allow Kolya to be left behind. It was quite difficult for him to understand her motivation. He’d never experienced anything like this before. She was utterly focused.",
    "The fire was burning bright in a nearby house. Hank pulled my arm and we slowly stepped out of the way of the road to the backyard. Hank grabbed my hand as we ran toward the fire. We were yelling for Hank's mom, but we couldn't hear her. \"Momma! Hank's momma! Momma! She's in the house!\" I screamed and screamed.",
    "Well what was I suppose to do? (And yes, I must've been a bit frustrated, which I told my students when I returned from leave. I'm sure they never would've guessed this about me from my students. But I'm glad they never guessed anything. The world would be a less interesting place).",
    "I thought I died a long time ago. I tried to laugh. But it hurt. I was beginning to break down and cry. I had had a few dates and gone out with guys I've met online. One guy in particular, an engineer, seemed very nice. He didn't call or text. Another guy, a 33 year old ex martial, was way too aggressive. I thought he was until I met her.",
    "He killed my father, I killed his son. That makes us even or so I thought.",
    "It was totally random that I survived the first fight. I fought hard, but I had a few helpings of luck on my side. That is, until the end. Everyone had their chances, but no one scored a big hit on the slug. Sade had a chance to kill it, but she missed. I have to admit, I was a bit scared at this point. I had been trying to hit it with the axe.",
    "He killed my son, I killed his father. Does that make us even? 13) He who accuses by false accusation ... will be answerable … OK, finally some of it makes sense. But how do I know who the real Messiah? 12) If you have eaten my flesh and drank my blood you are no longer one of them. 11) My side has been struck off the Book of Life.",
    "It was the worst of times in Belgard, it was the worst of times in the forest where I lived and I lost half my family and a few other kids. A lot of people said that I should go. They gave me a hug, they sent me a card from my doctor, they asked me not to go to the toilet and I couldn't even pee on my way in. I didn't know what to do. I never really knew my way around the jungle or where to live and how to feel and what to say. The pain of being on the border was unbearable.",
    "I'll tell you what you get. In the last few weeks or months I've learned how to deal with emotional pain in my relationships. When the pain starts, everything gets messed up. In fact there's a great deal of evidence to show that this isn't always the case, because what I think is a strong positive correlation happens all the time with how much people are feeling the pain before it's too late. Why do we think emotional pain is important? To create empathy, to create a balance. To give those who really hurt someone reason to forgive. Empathy doesn't just bring clarity through pain. It's an important part of human psychology. It's what makes us human. Empathy teaches us that we are not only human, but humanly capable of caring for one another. We're human. It gives us the capacity to make the most of the situations we encounter, to seek support when we come through them, to deal with pain no matter how difficult but making progress. It's what makes others feel cared for - and what makes us compassionate to others",
    "Let me tell you a little about myself, I'm an accomplished chef, a master blender and a very kind man, the way they look at what they offer, who they give to people and how many people are invited to make them food.\"",
    "Let me tell you a little about myself, you see, if I be wrong then I am no more and no less of a genius than your man and any other person I meet, but how you think so.",
    " had one day at this house, and I was in my third marriage and it never quite worked out, but we found ourselves married, and I went home and told my mother. It was a real relief and she called me and said she had a girl who had been sick since she was six years old. And I was so sad because she said this girl is my daughter at nine. So she said her mom had been sick. It was a big moment in my life, because I'm pretty sure I had it all under control. But even having the idea of getting out of bed with someone I don't know for as much as a couple of hours was great for my mental health.",
    'When the war came to Norvak, Bontia was a captive of his brother, and he would not come to him until the end of the war, when he was sent a copy of his letters to the prince of Norvak. Therefore he was a prisoner of Norvak, and he thought it was a good thing to come. But the prince came to Orlal and said to him, "I will not have you in Norvak, for I shall not have any friend among the kings of Orlal, or among any kingdom other than that of the king of Orlal, to follow you into the realm of Orlal; for I will not be taken as my enemy-I shall be taken for the sake of the king of Orlal. And there is said that in your kingdom there is no ruler more noble than the king of Norvak." "I never saw such a prince in my country," said Orlal, "who would give an account of himself when he met me on my way into the realm of Norvak. So I went out and asked whether there is anything here other than a king of Norvak."',
    "I recall growing up in what was once called Orlal. It was a rural town of 6,000 people. We grew up surrounded by beautiful, and somehow haunted woods.",
    "I recall growing up in what was once called Orlal.  It was an old city in the centre of the city that was basically a city like any other in the region, but with over 5,000 residents and a thriving art scene.  The area has always been part of Orlal.  This city is the heart of the Orlal region. ",
    "My parents are not much. My parents work only like a pack of wolves. They are too fat to know how to do something amazing or to think clearly.",
    'When the war came to Norvak, Bontia was an exile, and his family had been killed under the siege of Vyr\'s. On the day when her daughter became queen, Bontia was taken out by the natives as a gift. After he had been taken, he said, "Let us look at you again. I cannot tell them the name of your brother because they think it a lie." Then he told him not, and said he did not remember.',
    "I recall growing up in what was once called Orlal.  People thought that the forest (Tanya Rufus) was inhabited by elves.  I guess I only had the impression that if the trees did not grow, or at least that they started eating wood it would probably affect the other species that could live there. But I also remember vividly, once in a while, that the children of Orlal came home from watching the battle they fought against the Elves.  After our children had finished the battle we talked about the story, and while we had children we still knew little about it from their early days living under the trees.",
    "Tanya (Tanya Rufus): The Forest of Elves had always been a beautiful place.  It was made up of many tall trees that were lined by trees on every part of the forest floor, and it also included a lake that I have ever seen, which is one of the best places to get water on the continent.  The lake is so clean that I could always taste the fruits and vegetables when I was sitting on it. "
    "When we were young I noticed that there was often a dragon on the water at night, but the creatures would never come back to see us.  I've never been able to tell whether or not the dragons ever died or not.  They actually made sure to tell us everything they knew about the place.",
    "When the war came to Norvak, Bontia took a far more active role in the affairs of the people and sought to take over all the military and police functions in the cities",
    "I recall growing up in what was once called Orlal.  While the hills were dotted with bamboozle-like houses, I became fascinated with the local beauty that existed, so when I was born I saw small, green houses, with lush green grass, on a nice, nice farm.  In another part of the farm I saw tiny, green plants growing up.  This farm was filled with green tomatoes, a variety I would never have seen before.  The farm had a beautiful view of the sky, a beautiful house with a beautiful garden.  My grandparents said it was wonderful, something that was so special to them. ",
    "I loved my town inside of Norvak. I was really on the edge when I came here; I knew how difficult, how difficult to move into a new country. I was in my own country, and my family, and this is where I had this moment.",
    'This was one of the greatest joys of my life, I remember now, because in the days before I was born, my father said to me, "We live in paradise, I do not want anyone to lose their sense of humour, for we do not want people to cry or cry all the time", but here I have not been able to keep up with the same happiness anymore. But I hope that we\'ll have this experience again. I hope, I hope we can have this experience again and I truly wish for a day of gratitude as I try to get the chance of happiness.',
    "I lived in a town of Norvak. We would come across farmers who used to go for two nights to go to their garden for milk and meat, and take a nap in a barn where their children stayed and their dog ate them! The meat came every three months. I used to know the local farmers and take over for them and we would have them take orders, sell the chicken, sell the sausage and all the milk and milk and so on. We became extremely rich and well known.",
    "I have seen the battle lands up close and personal and in peace with myself, with everyone. I am here to fight to get an unfair advantage. I had a really good time here and there. There I have my first fight with the people of the west. I hope to have my last fight with a certain opponent of mine.",
    "When the war came to Norvak, Kirl's blood ran cold. She and his wife were driven to her native land. A strong spirit was brought to Nalag.",
    "Have you heard there's a dragon flying around the remains of Norvak? A dragon is another name for Ahaara, or The Forgotten Beast",
    "I am in search of the Forgotten Beasts. I have collected these things that must be taken into the Dark Arts, for that is the last part of their training, to be taught what they can and cannot do. They cannot be taught by the Light; they must be taught by them, all through their dreams and dreams and dreams—though they may be taught by the Darkness, through dreams and dreams; and when they meet they will be judged for a thousand souls, and when they die they will be judged for fifty.",
    "I felt his soul begin to move once more; he realized what the world was like, the fact that he was not alone, and that he had come to the Dark Arts with some hidden plan. I began to recall what sort of dark magic he had used—the Force of a Darkness, or the Force of Heaven—and why he needed it. I remembered that Yves had used one of the various techniques in the Dark Arts to bring about his death, or perhaps to create some sort of dark magic; perhaps he created other sorts of dark magic for his children. ",
    "I remember how Yves had created Death as a form of torture and magic—how he wanted it to be all along—but it was not in his mind to know this was even possible, and I saw that Yves had been aware of his existence. ",
    "Do you believe in Yves? We believe in it. We believe in it. And at the end of the day the problem is, we're trying to do us some good and we're hoping it's going to be good.",
    "Do you believe in Yves? I don't know why I never believed in Yves. I was taught that you should only believe in what was true. ",
    "Do you believe in Yves? Is he a god of love? What will you be doing after you graduate? Or will you seek your fate alone in prison?",
    "I have seen the battle lands up close and personal, of which I remember seeing a hundred at times. Of which I will say that I see no difference in terms of the amount of men or beasts who are put together upon this point.",
    "I have seen the battle lands up close. Many have fallen for such disgrace! And how could they dare to use your name to spread fear through our land?! I want your name in my heart to be for the people who died while you were alive!",
    "The only consolation is that I shall not be found willing to forgive myself, until my conscience and conscience have shown me this way, for I had been too much deceived, and had too many a few of my own friends to convince me of the true faith that so many others so often were. ",
    "The Battle of Orlal was the main event of the first Crusade between the Orlal people and the other nations. ",
    "During the Crusades a total of thirteen invasions have been decided by conquest, of which only Orlal and other Western peoples have ever successfully fought during their whole existence. "
    "Scold the moon, seek the Moonstone.",
    "While there were numerous wars, the warlords were always able to carry out peace agreements that were well beyond the pale of the Warlord Warlord Empire. ",
    "To keep from having to rely on their soldiers and their allies, many of the Black Legion slaves fought under the banner of the Black Legion. Even the Black Legion's slaves most dangerous members fought in groups.",
    "By the third war, however, the Black Legion had many enemies in ruins.",
    "The war was fought from the north by the Northern Highlanders with a force of 6,000 knights. It was said that The Black Hand led the First Crusaders away from Orlal and they were unable to fight at the Battle of Elphinstone. "
    "The Knights of the West were led by Lieutenant Nilese and he was able to fight by magic. Their magic was only used by soldiers on foot, and they used the only real magic they had. ",
    "Seek the moonstone. But let's not overstretch it.",
    "The light of a moonstone is drawn directly from an inner space. It has to be directly touched with whatever means necessary to create the effect. ",
